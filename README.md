# Calculating Editor Usage Stats

This set of scripts was made for updating the [Editor Usage Stats](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Editor_usage_stats) page
on the OpenStreetMap Wiki. It shows number of changesets, edits and unique users for every popular OSM editor.

## Usage

Download a changeset bz2 file from [planet.osm.org](https://planet.openstreetmap.org/). Then run:

    curl -L <changeset.bz2_url> | bzcat | ./xml2csv.pl | gzip > changesets.csv.gz

> (Script xml2csv.pl take approximately 30mn on a regular computer) 

After that use `stats.pl` for calculating stats for a given year or month. By default it
prints statistics for the current year. Specify an optional parameter for filtering dates:

    gzip -dc changesets.csv.gz | ./stats.pl 2015 > 2015.lst
    
> (Script stats.pl take approximately 2mn on a regular computer) 

For getting stats for year 2015. You can get stats for a specific month by using e.g. `2016-07` as a parameter.

## Other Scripts

*Wiki.pl* prepares a wiki page for publishing to [Editor Usage Stats](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Editor_usage_stats).

*Poi.pl* downloads daily replication diffs for a year and prepares statistics on how many
POI were added or modified with major editors.
